== Introduction ==

The Mite provides many useful features for debugging target boards:

* USB to serial interface, terminating with DTE female configuration
(equivalent to the end of a null modem cable)
* Power cycling target, up to 16V, 16A, Rds on 4.1mOhm
* Power monitoring of target (voltage and current)
* Two soft switches for power/reset/etc

== USB to Serial Interface ==

The USB to serial interface is provided by the second port of the FTDI 2232D
chip. RS232 levels are provided on a DB9 female connector in a DTE (null
modem) configuration. For boards with a DCE connector, the Mite can be
plugged in directly.

== Power Cycling ==

Power cycling is provided via a P-Channel mosfet, the Infineon IPD90P03P4L-04.
The jumper next to the power block controls the source of power used, USB if
the jumper is set, or Vin if the jumper is removed. Enabling and disabling the
mosfet is done via a FT2232D GPIO.

== Power Monitoring ==

Power monitoring is performed via a TI INA219 I2C current/voltage monitor. A
50mOhm current sense resistor is used. The I2C bus is connected through the
FT2232D I2C interface.

== Soft Switches ==

Back to back mosfets provide soft switch support. When the soft switch is open,
resistance is very high (above 1 MOhm), when the switch is closed, resistance
is in the 3 Ohm range.

The actual configuration of the physical switches they connect to is not
important (pullup, pulldown, etc) so long as the voltage is not above 5V.
Additionally, the Mite and the target board need to share a ground reference
for the soft switches t work properly.

The soft switches are controlled through FT2232D GPIOs.

== Indicators ==

The board contains two indicator LEDs. The one near the USB connector indicates
that the board is operational, the indicator near the serial connector indicates
that the target is receiving power.

== Mite Utility ==

The Mite utility uses libftdi to provide access to the Mite board. To read
power consumption, just run the mite utility:

./mite

shunt 0.020500V, bus 5.125000V
5.125000V * 410.000mA = 2101.2500mW

To set or clear soft switches or the power mosfet, use set/clear an the name
of the GPIO:

./mite set user		# Close the user soft switch
./mite clear power	# Turn off the power mosfet

If more than one Mite is connected, an argument can also be passed to indicate
which USB device to open. The format used is the one supported by
ftdi_usb_open_string:

d:<devicenode> path of bus and device-node (e.g. "003/001") within usb device
tree (usually at /proc/bus/usb/)

i:<vendor>:<product> first device with given vendor and product id, ids can
be decimal, octal (preceded by "0") or hex (preceded by "0x")

i:<vendor>:<product>:<index> as above with index being the number of the
device (starting with 0) if there are more than one

s:<vendor>:<product>:<serial> first device with given vendor id, product id
and serial string

So to open the reset soft switch of a Mite with a specific serial number:

./mite s:0x0403:0x6010:0008 clear reset

To check power based on a specific sysfs path:

devpath=/sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.1.1.1
dev=$(printf "%03d/%03d" $(cat "$devpath/busnum") $(cat "$devpath/devnum")
./mite d:$dev
